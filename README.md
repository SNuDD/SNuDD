# SNuDD

SNuDD (Solar Neutrinos at Direct Detection experiments) is a python package for accurate computations of solar neutrino scattering rates in direct detection (DD) experiments in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). It was developed and utilsied for the NSI sensitivity estimates of the xenon-based DD experiments XENON, LUX-ZEPLIN and DARWIN performed in [*A direct detection view of the neutrino NSI landscape*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12846).
